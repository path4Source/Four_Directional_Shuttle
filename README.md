Dataset for Four-Directional Shuttle System Tasks
Description
This dataset is for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms in a four-directional shuttle storage system, specifically using an improved genetic algorithm. It includes tasks for a simulated environment where shuttle systems operate on a 21-row by 21-column grid, handling both inbound and outbound tasks. The dataset is split into two scenarios: one with a smaller scale of 40 tasks and another with a larger scale of 100 tasks.

File Contents
Small Tasks Inbound: Contains 20 inbound tasks for the small-scale scenario.
Small Tasks Outbound: Contains 20 outbound tasks for the small-scale scenario.
Large Tasks Inbound: Contains 50 inbound tasks for the large-scale scenario.
Large Tasks Outbound: Contains 50 outbound tasks for the large-scale scenario.
Each task is represented with the following columns:

Task Number: The identifier of the task.
Row: The row number on the grid where the task occurs.
Column: The column number on the grid where the task occurs.
Usage
This dataset is intended for use in developing and testing scheduling algorithms for logistics and storage systems. It can be particularly useful for researchers and engineers working on path optimization in automated and semi-automated storage facilities.
